# Nodes in Peek

Individual nodes within the Peek sidebar have their own context menu for quick organization.

## Node Operations

Clicking the dropdown arrow on a node provides the following options:

1.  **Up/Down Arrows**: Relocates the node within the current collection, allowing you to reorder parameters for better visual organization and logic flow.
2.  **Remove from Collection**: Unlinks the node from the current Peek collection. This is a non-destructive action; the node remains fully functional (and visible) within the Shader Editor, but will no longer appear in the sidebar interface.
3.  **Rename Node**: Updates the display label of the node exclusively within the Peek sidebar. This allows for user-friendly naming conventions (e.g., "Dirt Level") without altering the actual data block name or affecting other references in Blender.
4.  **Move Collection**: Transfers the node to an existing collection or initiates the creation of a new collection. This is useful for restructuring your interface as your node graph grows in complexity.
